1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,590
And this video we learn about rotations at the time of insertion that is at the time of creation of

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,550
a year.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,810
When we are creating an avian tree and inserting any key into a reality then some laws may become imbalance.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,550
So tree becomes imbalance.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,840
So go balance that we performed our patients so those rotations are named as another rotation out of

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,700
rotation a lot and all of our patients will understand all this for patients one by one.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,770
So let us start with the first one.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,220
First one a little rotation little logistic of initial three.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,930
Suppose this was the initial avian tree.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,830
What are the balance factors.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,170
See this balance factor of this zero.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,130
And this is one and zero.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,100
So this is one minus zero is one for balance factor of the smallest one.

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,590
Then I want to insert the value ten so after inserting 10 in this one for 10 will come then it's less

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,830
than 30 less then print so it will come on the side.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,410
So Turkey green tea and then what are the balance factors.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,700
This is zero.

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,350
This is one minus zero so one.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,280
This is it two minus zero on this site.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,120
So this is two.

21
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,290
So this new order became imbalance of the balance Factor Four should not be more than one.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,120
So what the balance factor is two.

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,940
So this order became imbalance.

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:37,200
No we're going to give the name for the imbalance when this node became imbalance because of insertion

25
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,070
of.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,110
So in direction Dr. Tennyson so that left off left.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,350
So I will give the name as an imbalance.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,680
So this is a really matter for a little imbalance.

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,420
How the perform rotation.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,520
Let us take the tree once again here.

31
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:04,400
Still perform rotation around this node still perform a rotation in the static direction.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,770
So what does it mean by rotation.

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,540
Imagine that this is a trader.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,460
Okay keep your finger here and pull the thread on this site pull the thread on this side.

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,610
So if you pull the thread it will rotate around the finger right so then it rotate around the Finger

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:28,710
Turkey will come on this site and printing will move up at here and then will move a little above its

37
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,440
position.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,740
So the tree looks like this.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,390
That's the meaning of rotation.

40
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:42,110
Hold your finger and move this node so rotate around your finger rotate around a fixed point okay.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,610
So this the rotated 3.

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,680
Let us check the balance factors.

43
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,860
This is 0.

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,860
This is 0.

45
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,280
This is one minus 1 0.

46
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,380
A lot of balance are on which an order we have rotated this node so at that place who is there not 20.

47
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,620
Is it balance or not.

48
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,470
Yes it became yes.

49
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,840
But in fact it became zero.

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,790
So on whichever known you perform rotation the balance factor should become zero for X1 earlier objective

51
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,850
position the balance factor was 2 not the same position the benefactor is 0.

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,450
So this is the procedure for rotation not for the important things.

53
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,240
First team what should be the name of this rotation imbalance.

54
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,780
I explain a little imbalance right.

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:36,350
So let us call the rotation also a little station so I'll give them the mass and then rotation.

56
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,000
So based on imbalance I have given the rotation name once was eleven now you can say that no no it is

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,310
rotating on the right hand side we are pulling it on the right hand side.

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,560
Call it has a right rotation OK.

59
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,790
That is also correct.

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,840
Then somebody say that.

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,210
No no it is rotating like a clock.

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,960
So it is clockwise rotation.

63
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,890
OK call it does clockwise clockwise rotation so you can give any name that is no standard name for this

64
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,350
one right.

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,330
This is a subtle patient.

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,810
There is no standard name.

67
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,570
So if you want you can give any name I have selected the names so that it is easy for understanding

68
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,200
even the complex things.

69
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,820
So I'm calling does a Latin mass if I call it as right rotation or a clockwise rotation maybe I may

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,460
not be able to explain you that things more clearly that is follow a little rotation.

71
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,070
So this is after an end rotation.

72
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,910
So this is about name.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,770
Second thing second important thing you hear me thinking that I have taken just a small degree just

74
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,710
with the three notes what I should do if the tree is very big so don't worry.

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:55,570
Rotations are always done with the three notes on me always so delicately notes even if a tree is having

76
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,290
toes and nodes also rotations perform over three notes for me.

77
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,450
So understand this clearly then two examples.

78
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,240
I will show you how this is done on bigger sites that results.

79
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,170
So that's all about force rotation right now.

80
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,170
Next we will look at r r or patient for all our rotation.

81
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,030
This the initial three balance factor leaves no to zero and this one is zero minus one.

82
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,950
So this is minus.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Next I will insert 13 this one so can I'm pretty are already there.

84
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,450
So 30 is greater than 10 and greater than pretty sweet comes from this not a balanced factor of this

85
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,860
one zero this is zero minus one minus one this is zero minus two.

86
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,100
So this is minus two minus two is not a valid balance factor but fact cannot be less than minus one.

87
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,380
This is minus 2.

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,730
So this nor to begin imbalance.

89
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,340
So why did it became imbalanced.

90
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,040
Because we have inserted Tati just now very we have inserted a right Chertoff right chain right.

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,320
It is a right cello right.

92
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,190
And so on.

93
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,480
So let us call decides r r imbalance.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
Now let us see how to perform rotation.

95
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,200
So I agree.

96
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,980
I'll take a dream once again perform rotation around this mood in this indentation third means hold

97
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,780
your finger here and pull this turn on the side.

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,150
So if you pull it down on this side then 10 comes here.

99
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,480
Burundi will take the place of 10 and 20 will move up a little bit.

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,680
Now the balance factor of this is 0.

101
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,810
This is 0 and this is also equal.

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,800
So it's perfectly balanced.

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,100
Now what should be the name of this rotation.

104
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,440
As I said this is r imbalance so let us call the size on our rotation only.

105
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,840
So this is r vacation.

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,240
So this is after R R rotation.

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,210
If you say no no this is less protection.

108
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,490
Okay you call it if you said no no this is counter-clockwise rotation.

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,670
Okay you can call it you can give any name you like that song.

110
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,720
One important thing in a little rotation the final result was this one previous rotation and this audition

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,740
also same result.

112
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,390
Yes in all four rotation that did just a three N V get the same result.

113
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,810
That is a balance.

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,490
Now next rotation will look at that is a lot for a lot of attention.

115
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,080
This is the initial treat.

116
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,690
Let us insert Brenda in this one so all right.

117
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,080
No.

118
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:33,430
Three's having tardy and can do indeed is less than 30 so it will come one less site but it is greater

119
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,950
than 10 so it will come on right side.

120
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,520
One of the balance factors this is zero this is zero minus one minus one.

121
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,210
This is one two minus the two.

122
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,980
So this is to do minus single.

123
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,950
This note became imbalance.

124
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:56,080
This is imbalance vision direction in session is a done just not being sort of 20 on which side.

125
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,550
Left right so left right first left child and right.

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,510
Che l r imbalance.

127
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,680
So let us call the size L R imbalance and hold orientation should we perform.

128
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,280
I will read all three here.

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,250
So forcible perform rotation around the snored like this.

130
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:25,880
So what then with the reserved thirty brandy and then right or ten holding a finger here or it and then

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,950
come the side Brandy moves up.

132
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:36,790
So this holiday tree looks like the balance factors of 0 1 and 2 not perform rotation around this morgue

133
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,060
like this what is the result.

134
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,460
Same order.

135
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:47,920
So trendy in the root 10 and 30 see put out on the side.

136
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:56,140
So Brandy will move up today will come down and turn also will move up the balance factor side 0 0 0.

137
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,170
What do you got to do this.

138
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,300
OK rotation and occupation.

139
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,040
This is also an art if you want to give the name based on the direction of rotation.

140
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,670
Just watch it left rotation then the right rotation so this is a lot only with that perspective also

141
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,150
it does so this is a lot rotation.

142
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:23,070
See this is one rotation only but there are two steps in this one so we call this has double the rotation

143
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,100
we call it gets a double rotation like that I will talk about this one this looks a little complex how

144
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,230
to do this so I show your direct method for this one let us take this stream once again here.

145
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,070
So this time should move this site route should move this site and this newly inserted move should go

146
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,700
in the place of route so Trinity will slip on this site right.

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,100
It will come on this site Turkey will move towards right Grandi when it went on the route pretty went

148
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,250
on right but instead of two steps we can see it as a single step.

149
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,590
So we have to send this nor there and move that northern on site for that solar water lock then order.

150
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,270
I will explain you quickly you have understood how these are working for our location.

151
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,800
This is the initial tree 10 in Turkey.

152
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,770
Right now we will insert a new element trained in this one.

153
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,650
So if we insert Brandy Brandy is greater than 10 but less than 30.

154
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,250
So he'd come to this site then the balance factors are 0 1 and this is minus 2.

155
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,700
So this became imbalance which imbalance right left.

156
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:37,950
So are El imbalance so in sharp eyed or orderly imbalance and loading sea we get that rather other.

157
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,390
So that's why I did not remove it.

158
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,750
We get that a on the always we are getting similar there for three knots.

159
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,990
Anyway you have to perform rotation on this one.

160
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:52,740
So I take a treat once again but in fact inside zero 1 and minus two perform rotation performed a rotation

161
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:01,500
with this node first so then that displays comes 20 and on the right side it will be Turkey for the

162
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,430
balance factor side of zero minus 1 and minus 2 then perform rotation around this more this more we

163
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:17,070
get that present tense pull the down 20 comes here today also more so we get that if you want to see

164
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,600
your direct method then this should be sent as a rule or a parent and this should move one left side.

165
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,890
So again this is also double the rotation right because there are two steps.

166
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:36,260
Actually these are the steps but for understanding we take that one so whichever you are comfortable

167
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,850
with you can follow that one.

168
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,290
That's all about four rotations we saw let me write on the rotations.

169
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,970
We have seen first as a little rotation the eleventh hour out on probation.

170
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,110
These are called us single rotations.

171
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,440
These were having single step and a lot an all of Ghana's double rubbish.

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,560
But don't count desires.

173
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,300
Rotations count as one only.

174
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,190
See there is a difference between a double and two.

175
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,890
So don't count the mass to rotation.

176
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:14,040
This rotation if I take a lot less one rotation but it is having both steps so it is double capacities

177
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,170
double sizes double number of steps.

178
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,870
Steps are double by so this one on me but his size is double.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,270
So that's all about rotations now out of four rotations.

180
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,330
I'll give you one observation that may be very useful for you.

181
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,000
That would be logical useful for you observe this one so all the four rotations.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,850
What does the observation look at here.

183
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,550
So using three keys or three laws.

184
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,620
So I have a three notes that is the three keys using three keys how many different binary search fields

185
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:55,170
we can form five how to N C and men plus one number of binary search streets we can create out of n

186
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,180
keys so far 3 5 3s we can create.

187
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,170
So what are those how they look like.

188
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,370
I will draw them.

189
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,430
See these other five trees out of three keys.

190
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:14,980
We can generate five different binary search trees to NC and man plus 1 5 our possible what is the height.

191
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,010
0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 2 0 1 0.

192
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:29,560
That is of minimum height so for trees of larger height and that is of smaller height AVR trees means

193
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,060
height.

194
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,100
Balance binary search tree so which is more height.

195
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,790
Balance.

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,070
So when you have three keys you can draw binary search free of any shape or a lot of binary so she's

197
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:46,380
only so if you have this one why don't you take that one change this one to that one horrible change

198
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,600
we are saying that we are performing rotation we are saying that we are performing rotation or this

199
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,210
one or this one are double the rotation right first on this one.

200
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,750
Next on this one or double the rotation Foster on this one then on this one.

201
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,880
So actually we have transformed these four trees and Kodak tree because that is height of balance and

202
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,060
how we transform.

203
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,230
We are seeing that we have performed rotation so this is the idea behind a trees so idea originates

204
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,300
from here.

205
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,740
Then you can have five different shapes.

206
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:27,440
Why don't you select that ship even if you've got this one modify it even if you got this one modified

207
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
it to that ship.

208
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:34,270
So this all about rotations at the time of creation at the time of insertion.

209
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,220
Next we will see the examples.

210
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,820
If a tree is bigger Howard or patient is perform I'll discuss various things in that topic.
