1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,500
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,020
The topic is height versus Nord analysis for aviary trees.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,900
Similar analysis we have already done for general binary trees and strict binary trees and also for

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,640
complete or strict energy trees.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,310
We have done the same analysis.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,520
I will do that analysis upon.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,900
So what do we have to do is if height of our aviary is given height as a given then fine minimum how

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,790
many ones are possible in that kite man Zimmerman how many lawns are possible in that pipe so a military

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,830
is a binary tree only basically by military then by Navy SEALs street then it is height to balance of

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,640
binary search for basically it is a binary tree.

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,360
So in any binary tree if height for tree is given then maximum how many nodes can we do to bind each

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,300
plus one minus one N will be dead.

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,410
Yes we know this one.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,020
So I don't have to explain that one.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,660
So this is coming from binary trees right.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,000
So anyway I will come across this formula once again.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,980
Now the question is minimum how many n if height is given.

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,970
So how to get the formula C formula by taking the sample values are examples from the observation you

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,290
can prepare the formula so formulas come from observation.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,470
Let us take some examples of some heights of a few trees then see how many minimum notes required.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,800
Then we'll come up with the formula.

22
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,760
So let me show you some examples.

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,050
First example let us assume that high.

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,290
This one.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,890
What about height.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,440
Zero level stock height from 1 onwards right.

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,710
So here we will start from the same height as 1.

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,620
Then just one Lord I'm not labelling I'm not putting any values.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,540
So how many loans required minimum one only maximum also one minimum one for one high does not zero

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,300
height is starting for one the next.

31
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,180
If height is two then minimum how many laws are required.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:18,470
Do not see as I do not if high desert 3 then the minimum how many n Reynolds 3 Norfolk y minimum 3 n

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,720
no wrong.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,010
This is wrong.

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,840
Is it a military aviator agreements height balance safety check the balance factors this is zero.

36
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,250
This is one and this is a two.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,120
This is not balance so I need one more Lord on this side to make it balance.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,460
Yes not a balance factor Assad 0 0 1 0 and this is one yes.

39
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,320
This is the balance that set minimum Nordmann.

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,390
It must be balance.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,130
So minimum.

42
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,610
How many notes required for notes required.

43
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,010
So take four then then to hide this for and then at minimum how many notes required.

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,180
One two three four is in balance.

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,230
No this site I need some n one nor is it sufficient.

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,900
No still it is in balance one more nor is it balance.

47
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,290
No yes that is valid.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,500
What about this note.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,030
This is not balanced.

50
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,390
How.

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,010
Now everything is balance.

52
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,760
Let us check.

53
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,740
0 1 0.

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,640
And this is one this is zero.

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,110
This is minus one.

56
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,860
And this is one.

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,270
One two three one two.

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,280
Yes.

59
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,450
So total how many in order to the flag.

60
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:36,820
One two three four five six seven seven Nordic flag mainly among seven North required for height four

61
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,590
where the heights are starting from 1 onwards.

62
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,360
That 4 5 also I draw I right here.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,990
There is no space on that site.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,630
If height is a 5 then the minimum.

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,000
How many noughts required.

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,200
I not right.

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,910
One two three four five.

68
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,310
No there's not balance.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,080
If you have five no deciding during this one for normal with there then only this balance.

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,200
Okay one two three.

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,730
Total one two three four.

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,470
Yes perfect.

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,910
Including that group.

74
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,030
Then what about this for this including this one one two three four you have.

75
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,960
So you should have one.

76
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,200
One two three.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,470
No it is balance.

78
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,640
Now here you have three.

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,220
So here you should have to balance.

80
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,360
Here you have three.

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,500
Here you should have to balance.

82
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,870
No this is a balance.

83
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,110
If you check the balance factor for all the lords then the tree is a balance.

84
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,790
But how many nodes are there.

85
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,090
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven two one.

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,130
So minimum two will static land.

87
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
Yes.

88
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,240
Now we have enough examples for observation and to get the farm along.

89
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,890
No I have some set of values.

90
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:55,040
Let me pick a better table if height is given then how many loads for a given height.

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:15,860
Let us make it our function so if height is 1 1 Node 2 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 4 7 4 7 5 2 1 5 2 then I'll extend

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,510
it 6 and 7.

93
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,900
Tell me the answer for this.

94
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,880
I got this too.

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,960
Let us observe 4 plus 7 eleven eleven plus one okay.

96
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,780
Four plus seven plus one.

97
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,830
Am I getting this value also like that only two plus four six plus one.

98
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,710
Yes seven.

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,330
How I got this one.

100
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,180
One plus two three plus one four.

101
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:52,740
So it means this one is seven plus two L 19 plus one twenty then how to get this one twenty plus twenty

102
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,630
thirty two plus one thirty three yes.

103
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:04,430
So the formalise number also laws for a given height as previous two values are either then plus 1.

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:15,960
So and off at minus two plus and of two minus one plus one plus one yes this is the formula then for

105
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,660
the very first value I should have two values with me so then height is a zero answer is zero then hide

106
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,430
this one then the answer is one right.

107
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,120
Otherwise this is done.

108
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,520
So in height to zero onset of zero height if one answer is one otherwise this is the formula used for

109
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:47,150
formula for a minimum is this one and for this this the table so minimum n can be obtained by this formula

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,800
so I should write on this formula here for a minimum N0 I would not write the formula I will say look

111
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,670
in the table so far a minimum launch to look into the table so if I guessed minimum go alongside a six

112
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,420
minimum print in order like this then there is one change here see I started height from 1 onwards then

113
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:13,650
I have only one note height this one onward so if height is a three then seven n seven notes right this

114
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:22,150
height is three 1 2 3 so maximum 7 N1 the height is a 3 so this maximum known formula we will get it

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,380
to board that ship plus one minus one but no we will have just to put H minus one formula because the

116
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,650
height is a starting from 1 onwards for maximum nought formalized this fund so if I add this one more

117
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,310
and these are two N and these are one two three four more so to square so this is one plus two plus

118
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:48,170
two square is equals to two cube minus 1 to cube minus 1 is what h minus 1 that is 7.

119
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,020
So yes we have a 7 or so this is 2 cube height is 3.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,460
So just to polish minus one Now we have the formulas if height is given that the minimum north and maximum

121
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,870
n we need another formula if no exotic given that modest minimum height and maximum height so let me

122
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:14,250
I don't know if remove this if and nodes are given then find minimum height and maximum height so if

123
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,700
you remember in binary trees what we did is we converted this minimum form a la to maximum formula and

124
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,850
maximum form a local minimum formula will do the same thing here so we don't have to do any analysis

125
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,380
see maximum laws are any equal to two bodies plus one minus one then minimum height will be edge is

126
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:41,360
equals to endless one log base 2 so log B is to endless morning of minus 1 because in power we don't

127
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,380
have plus one here.

128
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,680
So log based wind plus 1 then what about maximum height.

129
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,050
This comes from minimum North formula.

130
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:56,690
There it is look under tables so here also look in the table you have to look into the table how.

131
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,250
Let me give an example.

132
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,750
If I have a tool n then what is the maximum height size.

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:13,510
If I have putting n tardiness less than being D so beside only here only putting n also 5 15 n 5 only

134
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:22,880
maximum height maximum height 5 19 n height is 5 maximum so these are minimum notes required for getting

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
this height.

136
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,180
Now I have 20 n okay maximum height of 6 maximum height defects.

137
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,650
So from this to well go 19 maximum height is five.

138
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,340
Bring T2 today to maximum height to six so you can look into the table and you can read this letter

139
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,730
and stuff and stuff from height towards Lord.

140
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,010
You have to see from note towards height that set so you can find out.

141
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,910
So you have to practice this little bit put it by yourself using pen and paper then you will remember

142
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,990
everything right.

143
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,760
Just practice it once you will remember it.

144
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,740
So we have done in-depth analysis of a reality.

145
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:12,890
Now one lasting see this formula for a minimum number of nodes of farm like this one minimum number

146
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,550
of four nodes formula.

147
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,490
Actually this formula is meant for this one and also useful here.

148
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,520
Pi does given n minimum n formula.

149
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,450
This formalized same as Fibonacci series formula.

150
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,570
Yes Fibonacci series is famous for being a balanced series balanced series.

151
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:42,980
You pick any good arms off you will CCD like high and as a plus one any build done for example effort

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,060
10 and F eleven two thumbs then f 11 by effort.

153
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,610
Then if you do R F I plus one by F I.

154
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,100
If you do a ratio will be one point six approximately.

155
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,170
Not exactly.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,240
It may be 1 1 5 9 8 baby one point 5 7 also you should accept that as one point six or it may 1 point

157
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,140
6 1 6 2 also approximately one point 6.

158
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:16,520
So any two consecutive numbers if you take the ratio at is one point six so Fibonacci series is believed

159
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,000
to be are balanced series.

160
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:27,950
So this formalize a matching with Fibonacci series means aviary trees are also balanced does it prove

161
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:35,410
that they are balance because so therefore allow for more towards us height same as Fibonacci series

162
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:44,770
then one last time minimum hide is log in plus one base to maximum height look into the table table

163
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,460
is from the formula.

164
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,510
So from this formula contact calculate height.

165
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,270
Yes approximately if you calculate from this one there is a derivation if we derive that and get done

166
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:06,830
so then approximately approximately it is equal to one point forty four log base 2 and plus 2 if you

167
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:14,920
use this form land converted in dozens of log in we get the funds so minimum height is also logarithmic

168
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:23,060
maximum height is also multiple of logarithmic but logarithmic so aviary tree's height as always in

169
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,170
terms of the log that.

170
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,840
This is enough with the analysis of hi towards us notes.
